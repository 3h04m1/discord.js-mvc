# Discord.js MVC

## What is Discord.js MVC?

Discord.js MVC is a lightweight and user-friendly framework for building Discord.js bots using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. It provides a structured approach to bot development, making it easier to organize your code and understand the flow of data.

The framework is designed to be simple and straightforward, allowing you to focus on creating the desired functionality for your bot. It is not intended to be a comprehensive framework, but rather a flexible and modular solution that can be customized to fit your specific needs.

## Key Features

- **MVC Structure:** Discord.js MVC follows the popular MVC pattern, enabling you to separate your code into models, views, and controllers. This promotes code organization and maintainability.

- **Routing System:** The framework includes a routing system that simplifies the process of handling incoming events and commands. You can define routes and map them to specific controller actions, making it easy to manage bot behavior.

- **Modularity:** Discord.js MVC is designed to be modular, allowing you to selectively use the components that best suit your project. You can easily extend the framework with your own code or incorporate plugins to add additional functionality.

- **Extensibility:** The framework is highly extensible, enabling you to enhance its capabilities by creating custom plugins. This empowers you to tailor the framework to your specific requirements and introduce new features seamlessly.
